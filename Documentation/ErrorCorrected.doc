For this version 1.3  (improvement of the first version with .include)I have mainly CORRRECTED the next bugs :	- File name opening, was precedently limited to 20 open successively	because the close instruction was inefficient.	- Error messages :		- Had a wrong number when a comment started on an		instruction line and continued on the next.		- Wrong file name in some case, actually it's		still possible in some rear case, to have an error		specified with the temporary file name "TempX7178X"		would be interested to know if you discover some cases.		- Some relevent error messages are now given during the appended		scan.	- The temporaryfile is now cleared after each compile job, no file 	with this name should be inside the current folder, exept the one created	by the program.	- Possible actually to assemble as many programs you want with	as many bugs, without distort the behavior of the compiler => (A couple	variables needed to be set correctly before a new scan).HOW TO USE IT :.include  "FileName"   /* knowing that FileName could have some white in anypart		      of itself, to use The "  "   is the cleaner method, but it's		      still possible to write it like :		      .include  FileName       at the condition to put a carriage return		      directly after  FileName (no white at the end, except if your file		      name has one) */Also, all the FileName included with the .include directive need to be inside the samedirectory and to be less than 64 characters (only the file name, no path, so shouldn't bea problem).The number of imbricated includes shouldn't be more than 20, and the total numberof include directives shouldn't be more than 50.
