Converted from MPW2.0 to 3.2 RB * *1.31	changed define for MAX_MEM from 65536 to 131072 in unix.c *		Removed the Version number wprintf from main.c RB *1.32	Changed all functions returning a Bignum to have a Bignum * as their *		first arg instead. Gcc was generating rtd asm instructions which didn't *		work on a 68000. RB *1.33	Fixed the .File bug (.File "name" would lose the name) RB *		Added .origin code. RB *1.34  Fixed bug in .origin   .Pseudo jumps such as jgtr which are converted *		to brb, brw pairs are now correctly relocated. *				xp->e_xvalue = lastjxxx->s_value; *		becomes *				xp->e_xvalue = lastjxxx->s_value + code_base_address; *		in asjxxx.c. RTB *1.35	Rewrote .include avoiding the extra first pass. During tokenising *		(in asscan2.c) .includes are intercepted and the curr_in_fd is *		changed. The input buffer is discarded and the input file rewound. *		.line and .file directives are inserted into the output *		stream. An array is used to keep the stack of includes. *		Changes are made in asscan2.c at *			SCANEOF ( on return from an include file, returning to old file) *			ALPHA	(recognition of the .include keyword) *			DQ		(lexical analysis of the include filename, swapping to new file) *		 *		Refixed .File   (.File "name" rewound the string file on the first *		pass which was unfortunate if the lexical analysis had not been *		completed. ie. if the token buffer had overflowed.) * *		Fixed AUFS bug. Temporary files were being written out as TEXT *		files which were having unhelpful conversions between NL and CRs. *		Temp files are saved as type 'TEMP'. * *		.comm directives are fixed so that. At the end of pass one any *		undefined externals (eg. in the common segment) are allocated *		space. This is so that we may do away with the linker. *		RTB *1.36	Reinserted pass1_count=0 and pass2_count =0 in file_open which had *		been commented out. Symbol table must be initialized on every pass. *		RTB *1.37	Changed wprintf() to iowprintf() to avoid a lib conflict. *		Altered iowprintf() to use varargs.h. * *		Changed LITOP to LITOP_VMS (#) and LITOP_UNIX ($) to allow *		the # to be used to begin a comment (iff it starts a line). *		Allow # to be a comment if it starts a line so that UNIX  *		as code generated from gcc would work with AS. *		RB *1.38	Added a .boot directive. Source files with the .boot directive *		have there type changed to BOOT rather than AOUT *		Fixed a bug in includes so that failure to open an include file *		causes a sensible error message. (Rather than just dialogs). *		Modified the clear output window command so that the window *		is made visible if it has been closed. RTB *1.39	Added a message to warn that assembly was aborted if an error occurred. *		Finished the bug fix in 1.38. The filename of the included file *		is still used in error reportage even the file has not been found. RTB *1.40	Fixed embarassing bug with .boot. Had swapped the type and creator fields. *		Fixed .fill so that it gets the byte ordering right. Each long word in the *		number needs to be reversed. RTB *1.41	Added some support for reverse scrolling in MacVAX 3.21.  Since version *		1.00 the assembler has produced a bit map of where instructions start. *		However it stores the bit map based on the absolute address of the *		instruction thus .origin commands stuff things up. Fixed this by making *		the address relative to the code base. * *		Added ".version" and ".orig" to the symbol table. ".version" contains *		the version number of As * 100 (so it is integral) and ".orig" contains the *		base address of the output file as set by .origin (or zero by default). *		NB: could not use ".origin" as it was already in the name table. *		".orig" entry is necessary so that MacVAX can interpret correctly the *		bitmaps of files which use .origin. *		Version number is available to MacVAX for future use. RTB *1.42	Adding Apple Events to allow other apps to execute assembler. *1.43	Recompiled using the Metrowerks C rel 9. Had to make changes to startup.c *		to be apple event aware and disable the launch menu for the PPC build. */
