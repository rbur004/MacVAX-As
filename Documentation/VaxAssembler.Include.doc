/******************************************************************************* File Name : VaxAssembler.Include.doc* Author : Laurent Fawer	(For the modification related to the .include  * 						 			directive and for this documentation).* Date : 12 February 1992.* From version : as (1.23)* Actual version with include : as (1.3)**/This actual version autorize the user to use some include directives like :		.include	 "MyFileName"	/*the " are not compulsory but it's better */								/* to use it otherwise the carriage return mark  */								/*  the end of the file, therefore if there is   */								/* some white at the end of the filename there   */								/* will be part of it. 									 */														To work correctly with it you have to respect the following condition :*	All your include files have to be inside the same directory that the	main file.* 	The given file names should not exceed 64 characters, it should not be a  	problem because you don't give the path.					* How many .include	: 	The number of .include directive you can use is limited to 50	and you should not have more than 20 levels of imbrication.* Temporary file :	This version work basicly by creating a temporary appended file given to 	the main compiler, the name of this file is : TempX7178X it should appear in 	your directory only during a small time and be cleared after each compilation. 	If by bad luck TempX7178X is already inside your directory before you start, 	you have to destroy it, otherwise it could generate some errors.
